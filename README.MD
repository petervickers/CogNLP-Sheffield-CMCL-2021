Code for Sheffield University CogNLP Group's Submission to the CMCL shared Task 2021 on predicting eye-tracking information from natural language

We include three files:
CMCL XLNET, an XLNET-based finetuned prediciton and embedding model
CMCL ElasticNet, a model which uses the embeddings from a finetuned XLNET and generic linguistic features for predicitons
CMCL Feature Engineering, a model which uses a collection of  generic linguistic, reading specific, and psycholinugistic features for predicitions

Some of the CMCL Feature Engineering data is yet to be uploaded
